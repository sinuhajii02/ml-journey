# My Machine Learning Journey

This repository documents my journey learning and practicing machine learning, from basic concepts to practical projects and enterprise-ready workflows.
It includes environment setup, experimentation, model training, evaluation, and deployment experiments.

## Learning Goals
- Understand fundamental ML concepts: regression, classification, overfitting, feature scaling
- Apply ML in practical projects using Python, scikit-learn, pandas and joblib
- Gain enterprise-relevant skills: reproducibility, experiment tracking, deployment
- Practice version control with Git/Github
